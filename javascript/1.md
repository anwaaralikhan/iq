1-  Is Javascript a synchronous language?

Yes, It can be defined as a synchornously executed language. 

- The main reasons is that all the functions are executed thorugh a call stack structure.
- Call stack has LIFO data strucutre and can execute only function at a time.
- Although, there are several techniques to make javascript flow/executions defined as async.

2- What is Javascript Engine.

Javascript runtime environment is composed of four main code containers and an event loop, which together form modern JavaScript runtime environment. Those containers are

- Heap
- Stack
- Browser specific APIs
- Callback queue

Goal of former is to read the code and execute it, Where as Event Loop performs a synchronization b/w Javascript engine and functions executed in browser APIs.
